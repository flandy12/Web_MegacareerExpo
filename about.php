              <p>On August 2012, PT. Garuda Nusantara Kencana was formed as a successor of previous event management company called Prestige Organizer, a well established professional event specialist that provides complete professional recruitment events solutions. It had proven itself as one of the major player in recruitment events all around Indonesia and help established its previous parent company brand as a leading brand in online recruitment industry. <br><br>
            
              Garuda team consists of dedicated personel whom had an early foothold in the professional recruitment events and shares the passion to provide customized, hassle-free, quality events to fulfill your organization's needs. <br><br>
              
              Our core values (persistency, consistency and commitment with full integrity) underpin everything we do and the way we deliver our services. We embrace these values, both internally, in the way we work within the team and across the organization, and externally in the way we add value to you as clients. <br><br>
              
              Because we have taken the time to learn about your business and the goals of your event, you can rest assured that the event we conducted by ourself or for you  will be on target and in line with your objectives. <br><br>
              
              So leave the event planning and management to us. Let us look after the details and the heavy lifting that comes with planning a professional event. <br><br>
